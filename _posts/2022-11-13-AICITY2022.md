### abstract
Natural language (NL) based vehicle retrieval aims to search specific vehicle given text description. 
Different from the image-based vehicle retrieval, 
NL-based vehicle retrieval requires considering not only vehicle appearance, but also surrounding environment and temporal relations. 
In this paper, we propose a Symmetric Network with Spatial Relationship Modeling (SSM) method for NL-based vehicle retrieval. 
Specifically, we design a symmetric network to learn the unified cross-modal representations between text descriptions and vehicle images, 
where vehicle appearance details and vehicle trajectory global information are pre- served. Besides, to make better use of location information, 
we propose a spatial relationship modeling methods to take surrounding environment and mutual relationship between vehicles into consideration. 
The qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness ofthe pro- posed method. 
We achieve 43.92% MRR accuracy on the test set of the 6th AI City Challenge on natural language- based vehicle retrieval track, 
yielding the 1st place among all valid submissions on the public leaderboard.
