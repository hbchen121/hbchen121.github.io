### abstract
Recently, due to the poor performance of supervised
person re-identification (ReID) to an unseen domain, Domain
Generalization (DG) person ReID has attracted a lot of attention
which aims to learn a domain-insensitive model and can resist the
influence of domain bias. In this paper, we first verify through
an experiment that style factors are a vital part of domain
bias. Base on this conclusion, we propose a Style Variable and
Irrelevant Learning (SVIL) method to eliminate the effect of
style factors on the model. Specifically, we design a Style Jitter
Module (SJM) in SVIL. The SJM module can enrich the style
diversity of the specific source domain and reduce the style
differences of various source domains. This leads to the model
focusing on identity-relevant information and being insensitive
to the style changes. Besides, we organically combine the SJM
module with a meta-learning algorithm, maximizing the benefits
and further improving the generalization ability of the model.
Note that our SJM module is plug-and-play and inference costfree. 
Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our SVIL
and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on DGReID benchmarks by a large margin.
