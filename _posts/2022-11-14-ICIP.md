### abstract
Vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of
vehicles with the same identity from different scenarios. It is
a challenging task due to the large intra-identity discrepancy
caused by viewpoint variations and the subtle inter-identity
difference produced by similar appearances. In this paper,
we propose a Viewpoint-Aware Loss (VAL) function to deal
with these challenges. Specifically, we propose partition and
reunion operations in VAL, which significantly shrinks the
intra-identity distance and acquires viewpoint-invariant representations. 
In addition, we embed a multi-decision boundary mechanism in VAL. 
It contributes to enlarging the inter-identity distance. 
A comprehensive evaluation on two benchmarks shows the superiority of our method in contrast to a
series of existing state-of-the-arts.
